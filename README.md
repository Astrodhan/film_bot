# Film Bot: Automated audio-video editing

### We have two scripts in this projects:

1. Automatic video editing for a specific studio setting which has two cameras and four microphones. The task is to alternate between the two cameras semi-randomly (decided by parameters); and switch to a particular camera when one microphone is being spoken into.

2. Automated video editing for podcast styled videos where the camera shows the person who is speaking. Additionally we can put in a script to add images of the topics being discussed from a reputable stable source like WikiPedia.
